## Communication system

A communication system consists of agents connected by channels.  The state of a channel is called a sentence (or message), i.e. a channel carries different sentences at different times.  The state of a channel is controlled by one or more agents, and sensed by one or more agents.

When an agent causes a particular sentence to become the state of a channel, it is "generating" the sentence.  When an agent senses the state of a channel and acts contingently on that sentence, it is "interpreting" the sentence.

* I don't claim that 'communication system' is an ontological category. It could be more of a role or an analytical structure, i.e. we look at the world and call out a few entities as being a 'communication system' in order to begin a discussion about them.  In any case, if we don't have agents controlling and sensing a channel, we don't have a communication system.

## Reference

Noun phrase N refers to object O if every sentence whose subject is N means a proposition that is about O.

Disclaimers

* This claim (or maybe it's a 'slogan', or a definition) is a general claim about a system in which sentences travel between agents over some circumscribed set of communication channels.  That is, it is about a system, and isn't actionable until the system has been specified.
* 'Object' is used with reluctance.  It might be better to say 'refers to O' without saying what kind of a thing O is.
* 'subject' here means grammatical subject, i.e. a part of the sentence.
* 'Means', 'proposition', and 'about' are explained below.

## Meaning

A sentence S (on a given channel) means a the proposition C1 AND LATER(C2) where C1, generally speaking, is what holds when an agent generates S (places it on the channel), and C2 is what holds after an agent interpreting S does whatever it does, generally speaking.

* LATER is a modal operator similar to the deontic OB: an interpreting agent will bring C2 about.
* "Generally speaking" means we are talking about what is common to many communication events on a channel in a system, not any particular communication event.  We can't talk about this kind of "meaning" except as a generalization about the behavior over time of a communication system.
* We could talk about "generally" as implying that the meaning of a sentence is a statistical property of a system, although I'd rather not (I note that people usually do not do so, in ordinary conversation).
* This use of "meaning" coincides with one common use, but the word gets used in many other ways.  That might argue for qualifying it somehow, or using a different word.
* If C2 is empty - that is, nothing generally seems to hold when S interpreted - we say that S is 'declarative'.
* If C1 is empty - that is, nothing generally seems to hold when S is generated - we say that S is 'imperative'.

## Proposition

Something that can be true or false; a potential object of a propositional attitude.

* Just as a color-quality or color-variable (e.g. the color of the wall) can change over time but is a particular color at any given time, a proposition can vary over time but is a particular truth value (true or false) at any given time.

## About

A proposition P is about an object O if its truth is sensitive to the state of O.  That is, P is about O if there is (hypothetically) some change that could be made to O that would invert the truth of P.

* This definition relies on the ability to delimit the state of a given object.  Internal state such as hunger or temperature is pretty clearly state, but relations such as position (with respect to the world) and ownership (is what I own part of my state, and am I part of its state?) are less clear.
* 'Change' and 'state' are clearly closely related, perhaps even interdefinable.

## Truth and fidelity

Individual agent actions can have a 'payoff' for that agent. If the payoff is +/+ (positive for the generator, positive for the interpreter), the agents are acting cooperatively: the generator is 'telling the truth' and the interpreter is acting with 'fidelity'.

If the payoff is +/-, one might say that the generator has 'lied' to the interpreter, and if the payoff is -/+, one might say the interpreter has 'betrayed' the generator.

One expects an agent to modulate its actions to maximize payoffs. (If you like, take that as a definition of 'adaptive'.) In a communication system, the actions are generation and interpretation.  If the payoff is +/+, they will be inclined to continue communicating (generating and interpreting), but if the payoff to either agent is negative, that agent may stop communicating.  Since it takes two agents to communicate, the system will cease to be a communication system.

* What is a payoff?  In a biological setting, it might be an increment to fitness; in a commercial setting, it might be an exchange of money.
* The payoff to the generator is going to be indirect through a causal chain beginning with whatever change the interpreter brought about to its environment, not involving the channel and ending with some local state that the generator senses and 'likes' or not; similarly the payoff to the interpreter will involve a path from whatever the generator sensed in its environment, not involving the channel, to some local state the interpreter 'likes' or not.
* Mistakes can look like lies or betrayals; that's what apologies are for.
