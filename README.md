# communication

## Reference

Noun phrase N refers to object O if every sentence whose subject is N means a proposition that is about O.

Disclaimers

* This claim (or maybe it's a 'slogan', or a definition) is a general claim about a system in which sentences travel between agents over some circumscribed set of communication channels.  That is, it is about a system, and isn't actionable until the system has been specified.
* 'Object' is used with reluctance.  It might be better to say 'refers to O' without saying what kind of a thing O is.
* 'subject' here means grammatical subject, i.e. a part of the sentence.
* 'Means', 'proposition', and 'about' are explained below.

## Communication system

A communication system (not an ontological category, but an analytical structure) consists of agents connected by channels.  The state of a channel is called a sentence (or message), i.e. a channel carries different sentences at different times.  The state of a channel is controlled by one or more agents, and sensed by one or more agents.

When an agent causes a particular sentence to become the state of a channel, it is "generating" the sentence.  When an agent senses the state of a channel and acts contingently on that sentence, it is "interpreting" the sentence.

## Meaning

A sentence S (on a given channel) means a the proposition C1 AND LATER(C2) where C1, generally speaking, is what holds when an agent generates S (places it on the channel), and C2 is what holds after an agent interpreting S does whatever it does, generally speaking.

* LATER is a modal operator similar to the deontic OB: an interpreting agent will bring C2 about.
* "Generally speaking" means we are talking about what is common to many communication events on a channel in a system, not any particular communication event.
* This use of "meaning" coincides with one common use, but the word gets used in many other ways.  That might argue for qualifying it somehow, or using a different word.
* If C2 is empty - that is, nothing generally seems to hold when S interpreted - we say that S is 'declarative'.
* If C1 is empty - that is, nothing generally seems to hold when S is generated - we say that S is 'imperative'.

## Proposition

Something that can be true or false; a potential object of a propositional attitude.

* Just as a color-quality or color-variable (e.g. the color of the wall) can change over time but is a particular color at any given time, a proposition can vary over time but is a particular truth value (true or false) at any given time.

## About

A proposition P is about an object O if its truth is sensitive to the state of O.  That is, P is about O if there is (hypothetically) some change that could be made to O that would invert the truth of P.

* This definition relies on the ability to delimit the state of a given object.  Internal state such as hunger or temperature is pretty clearly state, but relations such as position (with respect to the world) and ownership (is what I own part of my state, and am I part of its state?) are less clear.
* 'Change' and 'state' are clearly closely related, perhaps even interdefinable.
