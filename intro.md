# Introduction

Two objectives here

1. Philosophers have been trying to understand meaning - by which I
mean, roughly, the relationship between what is said and the world -
for millenia, without a lot of success in my opinion.  It is my belief
that a study of at meaning in engineering contexts can shed light on
questions that to date have been in the domain of philosophy.
1. The role of automated agents (robots, "internetworked things", and
so on) in society is transforming rapidly. As more of these devices
are created, and their capabilities expand, two things will happen:
their linguistic competence will increase, and the specification and
correctness of this competence will become more important.  Who wants
to buy a robot that prevaricates, or is misleading?  I believe that a
theory of meaning in engineering contexts can promote the
trustworthiness and interoperability of robots, and therefore increase
their practical and economic value.

What I will do is to analyze communication and meaning the way an
engineer would, using state space analyses and verifiable system
properties.  The goal is to shed light both on the specification and
design of engineered agents, and on questions of human communication
that have confused the philosophers.
